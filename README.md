Python implementation of Git as specified in the tutorial [here](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#).

Point of this project is to understand structure of **Git** under the hood but also practice using various APIs, native libraries and of course Python.

1. Run `python3 setup.py develop --user`.

2. When done run `ugit init`.
